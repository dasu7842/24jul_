1.What do you understand by database?
ans-> Databse is usesually controlled by a databse managemnent system.
      Database is organised a collection of structured information or data.


2.What is Normalization?
ans-> Normalization is the process of Oraganizing the data in the database.
      Normalizition is the process to eliminate data redundancy and enhance data intergrity in the table.
      Normalization prevents duplicate data from coming in.

3.What is difference between DBMS and RDBMS?
ans->         -> DBMS <-

       ->Database management systeam.
       ->Data stored is in the file format.
       ->Individual access of data elements.
       ->Data stored is a small quaninty.
       ->This is normalization.
       ->DBMS support a single user.
       ->XML,Microsoft Access.

               -> RDBMS <-

        ->Relational database management systeam.
        ->Data stored in the table format.
        ->Multiple data elements are accesible together.
        ->Data store in the large amount.
        ->Normalizition is not achievable.
        ->RDBMS supports multiple users.
        ->Oracle,SQL servers.

4.What is MF Cod Rule of RDBMS Systems?
ans->
       ->Rule 1 : The Foundation Rule
 ->Rule 2 : The Information Rule
 ->Rule 3 : The Guaranteed Access Rule
 ->Rule 4 : Systematic Treatment Of NULL Value
 ->Rule 5 : Distribution Independence
 ->Rule 6 : The View Updating Rule
 ->Rule 7 : High-Level Insert, Update & Delete Rule
 ->Rule 8 : Physical Data Independence
 ->Rule 9 : Logical Data Independence
 ->Rule 10: Integrity Independence
 ->Rule 11: The Comprehensive Data Sublanguage Rule
 ->Rule 12: The Non-subversion Rule

5. What do you understand By Data Redundancy?
ans->Data redundancy refers to the practice of keeping data in two or more places within a database or data storage system.
      

6. What is DDL Interpreter?

ans->  Full Form:
                "data definition language ."
    ->>DDL used to build and modify the structure of table .

->DDL Query <- 
    CREATE  : use the create database and table
    USE     : to use in database
    DESC    : see the structure of the table
    DROP    : delete database,table and column
    ALTER   : add column,key constraints and auto_increment
    UPDATE  : update all detail


 
7. What is DML Compiler in SQL? 

ans-> Full Form:
                "Data manipulation language."
->DML Query<-
               INSERT   : use data insert into table
               UPDATE   : use data update in table 
               DELETE   : use delete records from database
               TRUNCATE : use delete all records from database

8.What is SQL Key Constraints writing an Example of SQL Key Constraints

ans -> SQL constraints are used to specify rules for the data table
  
  - NOTE NULL   -> column have not null value
  - UNIQUE      -> colume have unique data
  - PRIMARY KEY ->  use unique data and not null value,combination of a not null and unique 
  - FOREIGN KEY -> use raference on other table

9.What is save Point? How to create a save Point write a Query?

->The savepoint is use for dividing,breaking a transaction.
->save point use statement multi time use.
->Savepoint is a command in SQL that is used with the rollback command.
 - create savepoint savepoint_name;
 - create savepoint savepoint1;


10.What is trigger and how to create a Trigger in SQL

 -> trigger use to store data in database in automatically.
 -> Every trigger has a table attache
 -> Triggers automatically fire and save when data is update and insert
 -> trigger save history of data in automatically

 - DELIMITER $$ create trigger trigger_name (after|before) {insert|update|delete} on table_name for each row 
   begin
   insert into table_name set column_name = new.column_name
   END$$
